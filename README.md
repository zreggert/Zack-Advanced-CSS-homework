# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

For this assignment I have created a portfolio page that will showcase my project applications to future employers. In it I have an about me section to talk a little bit about who I am and how my journey as a developer began, a projects section with pictures of mock websites I have worked on and links to those deployed pages, and a contact section with my email, phone number, and online profiles. I intend on keeping this page update with new projects as they are deployed throughout the duration of the bootcamp.
