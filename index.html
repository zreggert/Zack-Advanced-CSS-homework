            <p>
                Hi! I'm Zack and I am a full stack developer from Atlanta, Georgia.
                I began learning code after the 2020 corona virus left me without a job
                for months and I became determined to learn a skill that would allow me to
                contribute to the world without being in physical contact with it. Since then
                I have loved my journey to become a developer and can't wait to build and
                design more wonderful projects with the online community.
            </p>
